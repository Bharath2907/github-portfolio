# REFLECTIONS 
## > Assignment 1 : Poster
##### I gained knowledge on the responsibilities of web developers, Android developers, and other developers through this Industrial Talk. In order to inspire and direct us in the right direction, the speakers also offered us counsel and pointers. They also introduced several software packages and job-specific competencies, such Figma.

##### I had an amazing day at UTM Digital. We get to see parts of the building and their place of employment. For instance, the HUAWEI IdeaHub Interactive Board was demonstrated to us by the staff in the TM Room. We also got to meet the employees and find out more about the range of work they do.As students, we gained a great deal of knowledge about how the UTM system functions in real life.

## > Assignment 3 : Report
##### Through this Industrial Talk, I got the chance to learn more about analytics and some of the jobs in analytics. A data engineer and an analyst, for instance. In addition, I learn about the tools and technologies they use on a regular basis, like Superset and Python. I intend to be more imaginative and inventive during the next four years. I can explore new things and stay up to date with the latest technologies because I'm always learning new things.

## > Assignment 4 : NewsLetter
##### I gained knowledge about the farm's operations, from how the veggies are farmed to how they build an online ordering system and guarantee that their clients receive fresh produce.Even in the event of a pandemic, this invention genuinely makes it easier for people, particularly women, to obtain fresh and organic veggies. Customers have the option to pick up their product from the online store or have it delivered right to their door.
## > PC Assemble
##### I have gained knowledge about disassembling and reassembling a PC thus far throughout the PC Assemble session. I was also introduced to a wide variety of PC components. The lecturer also went over the names and purposes of each component of the PC during the lesson.It was pretty interesting as we were following the lecture and doing it by ourself even though we have never been into the interior of a PC before.

## > Design Thinking
##### After completing this design thinking assignment, I understood that problem-solving requires creativity and cleverness, and I now know how to approach problems systematically. It is also true that teamwork is essential to complete a task; without the support of my teammates, I would never be able accomplish this project with me being suffering alone.
